      <p>
        To improve the application, I could have engaged more participants in the survey for a broader perspective, allowing deeper insights into user needs. Additionally, consulting professionals from the medical sector would have provided valuable knowledge on patient requirements, helping to tailor the app more effectively.

          Bio: <br>
          Jona is a retired 64-year-old man living with his wife in Pinetown. Health is essential to him; he is healthy but goes to the doctor for checkups every few months. He does need someone to remind him of the doctor's appointments for him and his wife. His kids who are adults and have their own lives normally remind him, but they also sometimes forget. Jona also doesn’t like spending too much time at the doctor's office as he wants to get on with his hobbies. He needs an application that will help him remember future doctor visits for himself and his wife.
